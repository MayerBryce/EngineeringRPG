For our project we decided to make a text RPG. In our code we split it up into 3 seperate files.
Our main.py file is where our game is ran and where all of our control flow for the logistics of the game are.
In the menus.py file we put all of our game screens, fights and transition screens throughtout the game. This file 
was used to make our game actually look like a game. In the characters.py file we have all of our classes for our characters
and bosses. In here we have objects to keep trakc of characters hp and attack damages as the game goes on. The game is run
using python3 in the terminal.
